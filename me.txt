You would like to know me on a bit more personal level? Well, thank you for that!

<p>To start things off, I have been enamored with web design since I was a little tyke. Myspace and Neopets were my gateways into the world of web development.</p>

<p>After a few tumultuous years (more like a decade) of attending school infrequently, 
    I graduated from the illustrious Georgia State University with a Bachelor's degree in computer science.

<p>To further my education, I scoured Youtube for tutorials and even purchased a few courses from Udemy.
    With those tools, I was able to craft this website into the creation it is today.

<p>I strive to create websites that are efficient, clean and up to industry standards.
