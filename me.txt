    So, you would like to know me on a bit more personal level? Well thank you for that!

    <p>To start things off, I have been enamored with web design since I was a little tyke.
    Myspace and Neopets were my gateways into the world of web development.</p>

    <p>After a few tumultuos years (more like a decade) of attending school infrequenly,
    I graduated from the illustious Georgia State University with a Bachelor's degree in computer science.

    <p>To further my education, I scoured Youtube for tutorials and even purchased a few courses from Udemy.
    With those tools, I was able to craft this website into the creation it is today.

    <p>I strive to create websites that are efficient, clean and up to industry standards.
